# Car Rental

Car Rental is a frontend project developed using Angular. It serves as a platform for users to rent cars for specific dates and cities. The project features a date picker component, integrated from PrimeNG/Calendar, for selecting rental dates. After selecting the dates, users choose the city for rental. The city names are displayed on visually appealing cards, which tilt and shimmer in response to mouse movement. These cards are implemented using VanillaTilt library.

Upon selecting the dates and city, users are redirected to the car catalog page. Here, they can filter cars based on various criteria. Clicking on a car reveals detailed information about it, including a slider gallery displaying multiple images of the car.
